# **Introducing CURE (Callable Units Recursive Evaluator):**

CURE is a unique programming language that blends functional programming with object-oriented features. It's designed for users who prefer a simpler syntax, free from complex keywords and memorization. CURE achieves this by offering a **typographical symbol-based** approach, making it ideal for those who want a more intuitive and visually distinct way to program.

**Here are some of CURE's key strengths:**

* **Keyword-Free Syntax:** Forget memorizing keywords! CURE relies solely on typographical symbols and their combinations, offering a clean and visually distinct way to express your code.
* **Single Function Definition:** CURE revolves around a single, modular definition for functions. This core building block is essential for creating any program logic, making it easy to learn and understand.
* **Highly Extensible Core:** CURE empowers you! The core compiler/interpreter can be extended by users. You can define your own functionalities and seamlessly integrate them into the core language itself.
* **Customizable Behavior:** CURE goes beyond simple code extensions. Even the core behavior of the language can be modified to suit your specific needs, offering remarkable flexibility.

**CURE is a great choice for developers who:**

* **Prefer a visual and intuitive approach to programming.**
* **Want to avoid memorizing complex keywords and syntax rules.**
* **Value customization and extensibility in their programming language.**
